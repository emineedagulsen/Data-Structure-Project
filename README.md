I’ve written it in C++.

First of all,the program wants you to pick a number between 1 to 10 with using keyboard.Number 1 which means that you have to add a movie with its name,rate and year is picked in this picture and they added to structure which I've created .

As you can see in the second picture,if you can pick number 4 the program shows you list of the movie which you added according to their release  year.If you pick number 5 it shows you list of movie which you added according to their names by alphabetical order.

If you pick number 3 ,you can change the rate of movie.You can see the list with new version of rate if print according to whatever you want.

If you pick number 2,you can remove a movie what you want from the list.

If you try to remove a movie which is not in the list,you will recieve a message like "there is no movie like this".

Lastly,if you pick number 5 you can load a file then by picking number 6 you save datas on this file.
